# algorithms-in-python
Python implementations of common algorithms arragned for students for whom interested in developing algorithm implementation skills and learning python. This repository is a beginner's playground for learning to code in order to become a hacker in applying new stuff

##### Some of these exercises are taken from the [Stanford University's Algorithms and Design Part I course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)

## Problems are organized as follows:
- **[Merge Sort Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)** is implemented
- The [problem](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/15) given during the lectures is implemented and do not hasitate to contact me to compare your results.
- [Simulated Annealing Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)
- [K means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
- For Neural Networks Implementation, please refer [my following repo](https://github.com/kirnap/Neural-Networks-Playground)
