# Implementation of merge-sort algorithm is purely for educational purposes.

# This example is an intermediate for python learners and will be really helpful to better understand the programming
# and algorithm paradigm and highly recommended for python learners.
# Input is an list of any length and any entries and the output is a sorted version of a list
